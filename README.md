# Personal-Server
This is a webpage for my personal server. More info in README.txt

### This is a Webpage for my dedicated personal server that I deployed using my laptop
For more explanation about my server is that im using my personal laptop. Which means the server will not always up 24/7.
It only works to retrieve files only from my laptop.

But to make things easier for others to see, I also deploy using GitHub web deployment.

This work around PHP and database (SQL) for its backend.
